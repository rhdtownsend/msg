Fortran Walkthrough
===================

This section reprises the steps of the :ref:`walkthroughs-python` ---
evaluating spectra and photometric colors for Sirius A --- but now
using the MSG Fortran interface.

Preparation
-----------

In your working directory, create a new file
:file:`fortran-walkthrough.f90` with the following source code:

.. literalinclude:: fortran-walkthrough.f90
   :language: fortran

A few brief comments on the code:

* The :code:`use forum_m` statement provides access to the :git:`Fortran
  Utility Module (ForUM) <rhdtownsend/forum/>`. For the purposes of
  the demo program, this module defines the `RD` kind type parameter
  for double precision real variables.

* The :code:`use fmsg_m` statement provides access to the MSG Fortran
  interface. Primarily, this interface serves to define the
  :f:type:`~fmsg_m/specgrid_t` and :f:type:`~fmsg_m/photgrid_t` datatypes.

* Because Fortran doesn't have :py:class:`dict` datatypes, the photospheric
  parameters must be passed to MSG as a plain array (here, stored in
  the variable :f:var:`x_vec`). A :code:`select case` construct is used to make
  sure the correct values are stored in each array element.

Compiling
---------

The next step is to compile the demo program. Make sure the
:envvar:`MSG_DIR` environment variable is set, as described in the
:ref:`quick-start` chapter. Then, enter the following on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gfortran -o fortran-walkthrough fortran-walkthrough.f90 -I$MSG_DIR/include `$MSG_DIR/scripts/fmsg_link`

The :code:`-I$MSG_DIR/include` option tells the compiler where to find
the module definition (:file:`.mod`) files, while the
:code:`$MSG_DIR/scripts/fmsg_link` clause (note the enclosing
backticks) runs a link script that returns the compiler flags
necessary to link the program against the appropriate libraries.

Running
-------

To run the code, first create a symbolic link to the demo grid:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ln -s $MSG_DIR/data/grids/sg-demo.h5

Then, execute the command

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./fortran-walkthrough

The code will create a file :file:`spectrum.dat` containing the flux
spectrum for Sirius A (as an ASCII table), and print out the
apparent V-band magnitude and colors of the star.
